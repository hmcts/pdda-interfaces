SET schema 'pdda'; - this will select the pdda schema. Ensure to set this before running any \i commands.


-------------
PDDA DB SETUP
-------------

Navigate to: 

	/pdda-interfaces/src/main/resources/database/scripts

To create the pdda DB, locate:

	create-pdda-db.sql

Either copy the contents of that file into a new SQL Script and run in DBeaver, this will create the pdda DB. 
Alternatively you can run that file in postgresql to create the pdda DB.

Now run the app using:

	gradle run

FlyWay will be configured to create all the tables, audit tables, indexes, constraints, sequences and triggers
for the pdda schema, by running the files with the naming convention below.

The database scripts follow a naming convention of:

	V1_*__ - These refer to scripts made for Pdda-interfaces
	V2_*__ - These refer to scripts made for Pdm-interfaces
	V3_*__ - These refer to scripts made for Courtel and Firm List /
		 Warned  List / Internet Web Page processing. In development also known as Pdda2.

If you wish to add the test data to your local DB please add this manually by navigating to the test-data directory:

	/pdda-interfaces/src/main/resources/database/test-data

Then locate:

	load_test_data.sql

Either copy the contents of that file into a new SQL Script and run in DBeaver under the pdda schema, this will insert the test data. 
Alternatively you can run that file in postgresql using:

	SET schema 'pdda';

To ensure you are running on the pdda schema, then:

	\i 'load_test_data.sql'

-------------
FLYWAY REPAIR
-------------

Make sure the following environment variables are populated. These should be the 
url, username and password to the database you wish to repair.

	FLYWAY_URL, FLYWAY_USER, FLYWAY_PASSWORD

Then run the following command from the project folder in terminal:

	gradle flywayrepair -i

----------------
ADDITIONAL NOTES
----------------

Refresh the database using the temp tables (pdda-create-temp-tables.sql is in the temp folder):
\i 'pdda-create-temp-tables.sql'
\i 'pdda-refdata-refresh.sql'

Housekeeping commands:
CALL xhb_housekeeping_pkg.delete_case_ctx(TRUE);
CALL xhb_housekeeping_pkg.initiate_run(p_run_type=>'C', p_success_log=>TRUE);
CALL xhb_housekeeping_pkg.find_all_hk_cases_for_deletion();
CALL xhb_housekeeping_pkg.process_cpp();
CALL xhb_housekeeping_pkg.process_judges();

CONNECTION DATA FOR BAIS SFTP TESTING
-------------------------------------

1. Setup test user on your Mac
2. Enable Remote Login on your Mac
3. Set the following values in your XHB_CONFIG_PROP TABLE:

	PDDA_BAIS_SFTP_HOSTNAME = 127.0.0.1:22
	PDDA_BAIS_CP_SFTP_USERNAME = (Your test user on your Mac i.e testUser)
	PDDA_BAIS_CP_SFTP_PASSWORD = (The password for your test user on your Mac)
	PDDA_BAIS_CP_SFTP_UPLOAD_LOCATION = (A folder on the testUsers directory to use to place the test docs into i.e - /Users/testUser/temp_bais_events_folder/) Make sure to include forward slash at the end.

4. Place the demo bais documents into that folder. These demo documents can be found in:

	/pdda-interfaces/src/main/resources/database/test-data/bais_events_test_data

5. Run the app and they should get processed
